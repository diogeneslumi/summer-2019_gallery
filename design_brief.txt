Color choices: I added the same background from Project 3 but at this time I am using the image itself to write on, instead of putting white background on main content.
For each gallery link a different color, purple-blueish, orange and green. Colors picked according to the layout of the galleries.

• 3 Gallery Websites

- https://www.pexels.com

  I think Pexels.com is a great open source website of images in high quality and makes it more interesting because a lot of photographers upload their photos there and they are usually very creative.
The downside would be the ads in the middle of the page when you are scrolling down and find a great image, when clicked it’s a profile selling them!


- https://www.pinterest.com

  For years I have been using Pinterest to find inspirations for haircuts, home design and cute llamas. I like the way images are placed, sorta randomly. I used to love the website! Nowadays I feel lost there, too much information, bunch of ads and not-so-cool recommendations for my personal taste.

  Minimalist website get my attention easily and this one is indeed very simple and clean. I did not find a downside yet but I will keep you updated!
